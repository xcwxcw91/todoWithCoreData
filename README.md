# TodoWithCoreData Demo
### this repo is to demostrate usage of Core Data, I implemented CRUD funcs to fetch/add/delete item from Core Data Persistent store. This project provides multi-thread methods for manipulating stored data. By using SwiftUI, it acquired react ability to sync with local data changes. 

### Technique
* CoreData
* SwiftUI

### Main functions
* add a new todo
* delete a todo
* move todo to adjust order
* input search text to filter from FetchRequest results
